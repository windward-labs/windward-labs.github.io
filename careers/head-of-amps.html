        <h1>Head of Amps</h1>

        <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lead the development and growth of Amps, our flagship Farcaster miniapp</li>
            <li>Talk to users, develop and ship product features, and work with our engineering team to scale the
                product</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About the product</h2>
        <p>Amps is a two-sided marketplace to buy and sell engagement. Launched on Farcaster, we've gone from 0->1 and
            proved demand for the concept. Now we're looking to double down and build a best-in-class social experience
            to help users earn their first dollar onchain.</p>

        <h2>About you</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You have experience shipping products that users love</li>
            <li>You're deeply immersed in Farcaster and stay up-to-date on the latest community products and protocol
                developments</li>
            <li>You're looking for a proven idea that you can help scale -- and benefit in the upside of your work</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Backend: Node.js, Postgres, Redis, Solidity</li>
            <li>Infrastructure: Heroku, Vercel, Ethereum</li>

            <li>Design: Figma, v0</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Culture and Compensation</h2>
        <ul>

            directly with our team to ship features and drive the direction of the product.</p>
        <p>This is a great opportunity for someone who wants to scale an early
            stage product with a proven set of early users.</p>
